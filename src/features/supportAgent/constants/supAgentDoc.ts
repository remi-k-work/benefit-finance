## Common Financial Concepts

### What is Compound Interest?
Compound interest is the interest on a loan or deposit calculated based on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. Effectively, it is "interest on interest," which allows wealth to grow exponentially over time.

### What is Tax-Loss Harvesting?
This is a strategy used to lower your taxes. It involves selling an investment that has lost value to offset taxes on gains from other investments or income. Benefit Finance automates this process for Plus and Private Client members.

### What is an ETF (Exchange Traded Fund)?
An ETF is a type of pooled investment security that operates much like a mutual fund. Typically, ETFs track a particular index, sector, commodity, or other assets. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs can be purchased or sold on a stock exchange the same way that a regular stock can.

### The 50/30/20 Rule
A budgeting technique recommended by Benefit Finance:
* **50% Needs:** Rent, groceries, utilities.
* **30% Wants:** Dining out, entertainment, hobbies.
* **20% Savings:** Investments, emergency fund, debt repayment.

### Fiduciary Duty
A legal obligation to act in the best interest of another party. Benefit Finance and its CFPs are fiduciaries, meaning we are legally bound to put your financial interests ahead of our own.`,
